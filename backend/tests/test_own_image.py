"""Bringing your own image generation (GLOSSARY.md「自带密钥」「生图」): a NovelAI token or a
relay's key, in either format, with its address and model. It is tried by generating one
picture, at the user's own expense and in the deployment's art style, keeping nothing,
counting nothing and recording nothing; a deployment without the judge model, which can
send no photos, refuses it without generating any. A text turn bringing it has her photos
generated on it, one at a time, apart from the deployer's: wherever the deployer has no
image generation, and whatever the user's limit on photos, for they count towards none of
it. One failing on it is not sent, saying it was the user's key, never falling back to the
deployer's, the key masked wherever it is told. Image generation is never one of the
exempting keys. In a public deployment, an own image service is reached only over HTTPS on
the public internet, checked on every connection, a picture's download too.

Driven through the backend's external API, the judge model finding every turn asks for a
photo and the image service, the deployer's and the user's alike, faked at its transport,
told apart by the key each request comes with."""
