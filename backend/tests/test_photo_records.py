"""Image generation in the activity records (GLOSSARY.md「生图」「运行记录」): every request
sent to the image service is a service call to `image`, recorded under the turn the photo
was begun in, however long after the turn it comes; billed one picture where one came
back, the wrong size or not, none where the service failed or took too long, with what
kind of failure it was. The dashboard prices pictures each, NovelAI's V5 Curated at its
preset, a relay's as an admin sets it. Driven through the backend's external API, the
