"""Conversation events (GLOSSARY.md「对话事件」): what happened in a conversation that is not
a turn, here her hanging up on the user (gift records are tested with giving). Reading the
conversation gives them among its messages, in the order things happened, an event written
while her reply is still coming after that turn; the conversation list's last message may
be one. She learns of one from a line before the user's next words in her prompt, which
slides out of it with them; memory and the judge model never see it. Deleting the user
deletes them; deleting memories does not.

Driven through the backend's external API; the events are put in the database as the
call that hangs up would write them."""
