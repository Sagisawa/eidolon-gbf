"""Which model each of the deployer's service calls is recorded as (GLOSSARY.md「运行记录」):
always the one that answered it. A turn or call takes the deployer's models together with
what they are as it begins (`LiveConfig.lease`), so one under way when an admin changes a
model goes on being recorded as the model it runs on. Trying a model in the admin console
is not a service call. The deployer's clients are made by a fake `ServiceClients`."""
