"""She hangs up from elsewhere (GLOSSARY.md「通话」「冷却」): once a turn in another
conversation, typed or in another call, has her fall into a cooldown with the user, she
hangs up the user's calls with her there and then, without waiting for the user to speak.
Idle, the call ends straight away; a reply she has started speaking goes no further, to be
recorded with what was complete of it, and one she has not is dropped; nothing said after
that is taken up. The browser is told `ended` as for a cooldown, with when it ends, the
「挂断了电话」event is written into the call's conversation, and the call is a success,
ended by her (「角色挂断」). Calls with other characters go on.

Driven through the backend's external API, with browsers calling in over real WebRTC
connections and the judge model faked turn by turn; what needs its timing held exactly, at
the Pipecat stage that takes the call's turns (see `test_call_turns.py`)."""
