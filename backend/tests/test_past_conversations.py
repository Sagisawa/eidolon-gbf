"""Her conversations with the user, for the past conversations panel (GLOSSARY.md「当前对话」
「历史对话」): every one, newest first, the first her current one, each with the last thing
in it as the conversation list shows it (her ending it passed over; null while it has none)
and whether she has ended it. Driven through the backend's external API, her ending one and
hanging up put in the database as recorded elsewhere."""
