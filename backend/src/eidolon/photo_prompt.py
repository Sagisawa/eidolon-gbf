"""What a photo is generated from (GLOSSARY.md「照片」): the photo tag she wrote, read field by
field, and the prompts the image service is sent for it.

She writes how the photo is taken (`shot`: a selfie, or someone else taking it), how much of
her it shows (`framing`), and three fields of English tags: where and when (`place`), what
she wears (`outfit`), what she does and how she looks (`action`); and a note in Chinese for
herself alone, never sent. What she writes is cleaned before it goes anywhere: the prompt
syntax NovelAI reads (emphasis, weights, alternation, comments, quotes, `Text:`) is
stripped, the tags put in lower case with spaces for underscores, and those the model
does not know as tags put as it does, by the local tag table (`photo_tags.json`, made by
`scripts/photo_tags.py` from NovelAI's tag suggestions); one it has no word on is kept as it
is, and logged. A tag that is never hers to write is stripped (ADR-0026): one of her looks,
an art style or an artist, or anyone else in the picture. Only that tag goes, the photo
taken all the same of the rest (`PhotoTag.stripped` says which of the three each stripped
crossed, for the activity records, never the tag). Each is written once, and each
field cut to its most; a field left empty gets its default. What she photographs, how much
she wears and how, is hers to write: no tag of it is stripped, and no rating is put in for
her. Neither the deployer nor any user changes the table.

The positive prompt is fixed around them: who she is (her character tag and the work's
tag), the deployment's art style, written in as the deployer wrote it (weights, artists
and all; none if empty), her looks, the tags for how the photo is taken, and V5's standard
quality tags, written out rather than left to the service's switch. The negative prompt is
fixed altogether: the Human Focus preset. Neither the deployer nor any user changes them.
