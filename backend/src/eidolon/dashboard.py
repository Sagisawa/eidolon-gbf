"""The dashboard (GLOSSARY.md「看板」): the activity records of a recent range of time,
summed up for the admin, under `/api/admin/dashboard`.

Everything is summed up here; the browser only shows it. For each service, on the
deployer's keys and on users' own apart: how many calls, how many failed and how, how
long they took, and what they were billed for. For turns (typed or in calls): how many,
by how they turned out, how many on users' own keys, how soon the character began to
speak. For calls: how many, by how they turned out, how many on users' own keys, how long
they lasted and why they ended. How many users took any turn or call; how many turns and
calls with each character, and in each stretch of the range (`trend`), in stretches
beginning where the admin's clock (`X-Timezone`) has a round hour or day. Nothing anyone
said is in it, nor whose any of it was.

How many calls are in progress now is not in the records but the calls themselves:
`/api/admin/calls/live`, which the page asks every minute.
