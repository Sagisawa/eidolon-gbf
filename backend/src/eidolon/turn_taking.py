"""The rules for taking turns during a call (GLOSSARY.md「回合」「补充」「打断」「只看文字」).

`TurnTaking` is all the rules are: `CallTurns` reports what happens during the call (the
user starting to talk, what they said or typed, how the reply is getting on, the
character's voice starting and stopping) and is told, event by event, what to do about
it. It keeps no time and waits for nothing; each event is answered at once with the
commands to carry out, in order, and by then the rules have already moved on, so no
event reported while the commands are being carried out finds them where they were.

    """Whose turn it is during a call, one turn at a time.

    A turn is taken up (`turn_started`) with what the user said, and replied to. Until
    the reply can be interrupted, what the user says or types is a follow-on: the reply
    is dropped without a trace, what was voiced of it is cut off, and the turn is replied
    to afresh with the follow-on joined on a new line. The user starting to talk is
    enough to drop the reply; should what they said come to nothing (transcribed blank,
    or not at all in time), the turn is replied to again as it was.

    A reply can be interrupted once the character has started speaking it, or it is
    recorded, and it has a complete segment. She has started speaking it (「开口」) once
    her voice starts playing; when the reply is not voiced, once its first line is shown.
    Her voice starting counts only once some of this reply has gone to TTS, since a
    dropped reply's voice may start late; and should the last reply's voice still be
    playing when this one's first words go to TTS, she has started speaking it then,
    without starting again. `CallTurns` is told she spoke (`Spoke`) as she starts speaking
    each reply, a recorded one too, should its voice start only afterwards.

    After that, the user starting to talk or sending what they typed interrupts her: the
    reply stops and is voiced no further, to be recorded with only its complete segments,
    and what the user says or types is the next turn. Typing between replies stops her
    voice likewise, should the last one still be heard.

    Whether replies are voiced (「只看文字」) is decided as each one starts. A voiced
    reply's Japanese goes to TTS segment by segment, each voiced in full as soon as it is
    complete, rather than held back for the next one's words. Once the
    call is ending, nothing the user says or types is taken up, and her last reply is
    left to be voiced.
