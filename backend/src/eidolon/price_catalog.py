"""The price catalogs online (GLOSSARY.md「看板」): models.dev's and OpenRouter's lists of
models and what each costs per million tokens, in dollars, input read from the prompt
cache too where they say, for pricing the deployer's service calls in place of the presets
(`prices`). The way magpie prices its calls (github.com/yetone/magpie, `internal/catalog`).

The catalogs are fetched in the background as the server starts, again once they are a
day old, and sooner when a model has no price (`refresh_soon`), or when an admin asks
(`refresh`). Kept in the database, they are matched to a call by the host it was at and
the model it named: the providers at that host (models.dev's `api`, or the few without
one written down here, or OpenRouter), then the model's name, as it is and then looser
and looser. A model at a host no catalog knows (a relay, a proxy) is looked for among
the providers that make models, and priced as its maker prices it. OpenRouter's catalog
is its own API's, not models.dev's copy, which goes without the judge models' prices.
The same hosts are the known providers', which alone users' own LLMs may reach through the
proxy (`known_provider`, ADR-0022).

models.dev's says how each model thinks, too (`Thinking`), found the same way (`thinking`):
for the efforts beside a model's to note which it is listed taking, a hint only, never
what is sent (ADR-0019). OpenRouter's says so in words of its own, not used."""
