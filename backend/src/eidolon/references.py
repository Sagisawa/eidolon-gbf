"""What a reference source is: one of the places a turn looks references up in (the
story, the character facts, the work facts), searched with the same query vector and
reranked together.

Each source carries its kind, the heading its references go under in the prompt, the
line telling the character how to use them, and its search; so adding one is writing it
and registering it where the sources are opened (`retrieval.open_reference_sources`).
