"""Uploading the stands to the bucket browsers download them from: `eidolon stand upload`.

What goes up is what the outfit lists in the build directory name (`stand_outfits`):
each outfit's `data.json`, `data.atlas` and `data.png`, as they are in the mirror (no
WebP), under `spine/idols/<category>/<enzaId>/`; its thumbnail under
`thumbnails/<category>/<enzaId>.png`, if it has been rendered; and the lists under
`outfits/<idol_id>.json`. The lists go up last, so that a browser never reads one that
names an outfit the bucket does not have yet. A thumbnail that failed to render is not
held back for: the list still names it, and the picker shows the card without it until
a later sync renders and uploads it.

An object the bucket already has as it is (its ETag is the file's MD5) is not uploaded
again, so a sync with nothing new only lists the bucket. An outfit's files never change,
so they are cached for good; a thumbnail may be rendered again, so it is cached for a
day; a list changes as cards come out, so it is checked every time.
